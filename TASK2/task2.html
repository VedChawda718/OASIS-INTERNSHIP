                    Ibrahimović was born in Malmö, Sweden, on 3 October 1981.
                    He was born to a Muslim Bosniak father, Šefik Ibrahimović, 
                    who emigrated to Sweden in 1977,[11] and a Catholic Croat mother, Jurka Gravić, 
                    who also emigrated to Sweden where the couple first met.

                    As a child, his mother sometimes hit him on the head with a wooden spoon, 
                    which would often break. After she was arrested for handling stolen goods, social services intervened. 
                    Concerned with his divorced mother's ability to cope with five children, one of whom, 
                    Ibrahimović's half-sister, had a drug problem, at age nine he was sent to live with his father.

                    Complex is the best word to describe Zlatan. On the one hand he's a strong, warrior type who knew he had to be very tough to survive. So he takes on fights all the time because he's always had to. But another part of him is vulnerable. He's a guy wounded by his upbringing, who uses all that to create strength for himself. In his position, 99 guys out of 100 would have gone under, but he used his anger to make himself better. He told me, ‘David, I need to be angry to play well’. When he played with middle-class kids he felt inferior because he wore the wrong clothes and had no money, so he said to himself ‘One day I’ll show them!’ That became his motivation.

                    While in his early teens, Ibrahimović was a regular for his hometown club Malmö FF.
                    At the age of 15, he was close to quitting his football career, in favour of working at the docks in Malmö, but his manager convinced him to continue playing.
                    As a boy, his hero was Brazilian forward Ronaldo.
                    An avid viewer of Italian football, another player he admired was prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta - a player with similar characteristics to himself

                    On 8 October 2019, a statue of Ibrahimović was unveiled in his hometown, outside Malmö's Stadion. The statue, created by Peter Linde, is 2.7 m (8 ft 9 in) tall and weighs almost 500 kg (1,100 lb).
